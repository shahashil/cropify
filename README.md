Cropify is a WhatsApp chatbot made with Twilio using IBM's Watson's machine learning which helps farmers to get predict their crops for better yield .
In Cropify farmers can get weekly analysis of weather condition which would be much helpful for their crops. Also we understand that at farms you may not get an Internet connection every time so we can send them daily alerts on SMS by which they can take appropriate action for their crops. They can activate or deactivate the alerts anytime . We created a Notebook Job in IBM Cloud Pak which will create daily SMS alerts for the weather analysis
